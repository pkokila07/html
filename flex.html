                <p>Tender coconut water is generally considered a safe and healthy beverage,<br> and it's often 
                    recommended for hydration due to <br>its natural electrolyte content. The glycemic index (GI) of 
                    <br>coconut water is generally considered high people with diabetes <br>should be cautious about their 
                    tender coconut intake. The sugar content<br> of tender coconut water can vary depending on factors 
                    such as the maturity<br> of the coconut and the season in which it is harvested.<br> There are several 
                    algorithms that can be used for size estimating of tender coconut.<br> One commonly used 
                    approach is based on image processing techniques, <br>such as edge detection, thresholding, and 
                    contour analysis. The project aim<br> is to develop an automated system for detecting<br> and 
                    classifying different types of tender coconuts based<br> on their external characteristics using a 
                    <br>combination of the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) <br>edge detection algorithm</p>
